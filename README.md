# Project Title: DÃ¶n-Air
 The project consists of a programm that allows users to register on a site and reserve a seat for their flight. The admin can manipulate flights and read statistics.
# Motivation:
 This project exists to enable users to select and reserve specific seats on their flight. It also allows the admin user to add or remove flights and see the statistics of their site. Airplane data can be added either manually by the admin or using a .txt file.
# Features:
 A normal user can register an account, log onto the site and select or cancel seats on their flight.
 An admin user can add or cancel flights manually or using a .txt file. The programm will read the file and assign the airplane data to a dataset. The aircraft data is in a format of columns and rows and is needed to display the seats in order for them to be selected by users. The admin also has access to statistics like the number of users, which specific seats are taken or general information like the percentage of seats taken on any given flight or the number of users. 
 A help section exists on the site, that explains how to log on and how to select and reserve a seat.
